# GrocerEase

GrocerEase is an innovative, new application that connects you to everyday people shopping for groceries in order to help you obtain your groceries in a safe and easy way.

## Installation

The GrocerEase application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This app runs by using Node.js and node package manager. 

### Install Node.js

For macOS, we recommend using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

For Windows, we recommend using the [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

To verify that you've downloaded and installed it properly, open a new shell instance and run the commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

They should print out the versions of node and npm that you installed.

### Clone from GitHub

To use GrocerEase, clone the git repository into a new directory. You can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solomon-lo/GrocerEase.git
```

To prepare to run the GrocerEase app, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Firebase and Mapbox

The GrocerEase application utilizes Firebase and Mapbox. To install, run:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

for Firebase and 

```bash
npm install mapbox-gl-geocoder
```

for Mapbox. 

## Run the application

To run the GrocerEase app, simply use the command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will then open in your browser. If you are not currently signed in to a Google account, you will need to do so in order to use the GrocerEase application. If you aren’t signed in, you can do so on the starting page by clicking on the Google sign-in widget.
