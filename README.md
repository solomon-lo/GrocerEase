# GrocerEase

GrocerEase is an innovative, new application that connects you to everyday people shopping for groceries in order to help you obtain your groceries in a safe and easy way.

## Installation

The GrocerEase application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This app runs by using Node.js and node package manager. 

### Install Node.js

For macOS, we recommend using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

For Windows, we recommend using the [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

To verify that you've downloaded and installed it properly, open a new shell instance and run the commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

They should print out the versions of node and npm that you installed.

```

### Install Firebase and Mapbox

The GrocerEase application utilizes Firebase and Mapbox. To install, run:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

for Firebase and 

```bash
npm install mapbox-gl-geocoder
```

for Mapbox.
